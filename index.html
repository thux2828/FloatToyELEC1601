    in the mantissa must not be turned off.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Some encoding schemes also omit the most significant bit of the mantissa because it is by definition a “1” (this is referred to as a hidden bit).  We do not use this.</p>

  <p>NB: This is a student-made app. I made it to help me get my head around
    floating point and thought I'd share it in case others can benefit too.
    It might not be correct. It was not created by University teaching staff.
    It may not be endorsed by them either.</p>
  <p>This is my first web app. I crammed CSS, HTML and Javascript in one
    afternoon, so there's a high probability of messy code and bugs. Credit for the idea goes to <a href = "https://evanw.github.io/float-toy/">Evanw's IEEE Float Toy</a>.
